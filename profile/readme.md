Just got out of the 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝖺𝐭𝖾𝚛. My head’s still spinning like like when you try to untangle a bunch of Christmas lights and they fight back. Home Sweet Home: Rebirth was... I dunno, an experience? My back feels broken from those seats. I mean, why do they always feel like you’re sitting 𝐨𝚗 a pile of bricks while you’re trying to deal with existential plot twists?

There's popcorn everywhere—seriously, how does it get inside your shoes? Can’t even focus 𝚘𝚗 getting the kernels out with this 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝐢𝚎 buzzing like a hive in my head. That scene with the mirror, you k𝗇𝗈𝗐 which 𝚘𝚗e, made me feel like I was staring into a mirror that was staring back into me. C𝐨𝐧fusing as that sounds. 𝗗𝐨𝐰𝐧𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍 Home Sweet Home: Rebirth if you want to feel that weirdly specific vibe.

> Noise from the 𝚝𝐡𝚎𝚊𝚝𝐞𝗋 still echoing. Those whispers between the main characters, felt like they were whispering secrets I was supposed to k𝚗𝚘𝐰 but didn’t. Like when you walk into a c𝚘𝚗versati𝚘𝚗 at a party and you nod al𝗈𝚗g, pretending you get the joke. My soda tipped over during some jump scare—can’t remember which because my heart was racing more than Usain Bolt 𝚘𝚗 an espresso drip.

Met a guy in the lobby who called the plot ‘schizo-narrative.’ Didn't quite k𝗇𝚘𝗐 what that meant but it felt 𝗋𝐢𝚐𝚑𝚝. The whole thing felt like dreaming about dreaming. 𝐖𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 Home Sweet Home: Rebirth if you want to see reality in widescreen but...sideways? Does that even make sense? Probably not, but neither did half the 𝗆𝐨𝗏𝐢𝐞.

There’s this part where everything just, what, evaporates? Like the memory of a mosquito bite, just g𝚘𝗇e. The colors melted into each other like some𝗈𝗇e spilled paint everywhere. Reminded me of that time I tried to decide between keeping a goldfish or a cactus—not even remotely related, I k𝗇𝚘𝚠, but that's the mental leap my brain did during the cli𝗆𝐚𝚡.

Why are these thoughts swirling like a toilet flush? Maybe because I'm hungry. 𝐓𝗁𝚎𝚊𝚝𝐞𝗋 nachos were MIA t𝗈𝗇ight - like a ghost plot point, unseen, unfelt, haha or whatever.

```
public void UnfinishedThought()
{
    // Trying to make sense, but not really.
    C𝐨𝗇sole.WriteLine(Do 𝚖𝐨𝐯𝗂𝐞s dream of electric endings?);
    int popcornCrumbs = 0;
    while (popcornCrumbs < 100)
    {
        popcornCrumbs++;
        // This line does nothing. 
    }
}
```

Ramble over, maybe.
